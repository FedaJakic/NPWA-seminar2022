      "Founded in March 2013, Space Cowboys is a brand new company/boardgame studio, but that much can't be said about its members, as the name may suggest. The Space Cowboys project originally stems from Marc Nunes, Philippe Mouret and Croc, Asmodee's three founding (grand)fathers. After 23 years, you could say they've fallen into a certain routine, which is why they wanted to go back to their origins — that is, designing and publishing games. But even with as much vigor as they still have, you need more than three geezers to get a rocket going! They therefore asked two young technicians to join them on their journey: Cyril Demaegd (Ystari) and Sebastien Pauchon (GameWorks). As both of them agreed to come aboard, in the end the Space Cowboys team consists of five members. The idea being 'to publish games we find cool', the range of styles from Space Cowboys might end up being quite large. The future will tell...",

      "We are a group of people who love board games and enjoy creating entertainment for players like we are. Back in 2006, we worked together on the first edition of Through the Ages, and we decided that this is the work we wanted to do for a living. Founded in 2007, Czech Games Edition (CGE) released our first titles in Galaxy Trucker by Vlaada Chvátil and League of Six by Vladimír Suchý. Since then, CGE has published over 40 games and expansions, including Codenames, Alchemists, Tzolk’in, Letter Jam, Pulsar 2849, Dungeon Petz, Space Alert, Last Will, Tash-Kalar, and many others. In 2014, we expanded into the realm of digital board games with the implementation of Galaxy Trucker, followed by Through the Ages. Now, the digital team is working on the digital version of Codenames. CGE introduced the complete novelty of our portfolio in 2017 when we published our first novel – Galaxy Trucker: Rocky Road by Jason A. Holt. The story takes place in the goofy Galaxy Trucker universe. 2020 was challenging, and we tried a new approach with our games. First, we focused on solo, or 1-player games, such as Under Falling Skies, Sanctum Singleplayer, and Adrenaline Solo Play DLC. Then we tackled the problem of how to connect with remote players and came up with our free solution, Codenames Online. Focused on publishing the games of Czech and Slovak authors such as Vlaada Chvátil, Vladimír Suchý, Matúš Kotry, Ondra Skoupý, Tomáš Uhlík Uhlíř, and designer couple Mín and Elwen.",

      "This Slovenian company has been dealing with board games for 15 years and is the largest publisher of board games in the Slovenian language. So far, they have published over 70 board games in Slovenian and 12 in Croatian - right now they are working on several more Croatian translations, in which our Association is also helping them. They cooperate with larger publishers from Germany and other countries that do not work according to the system of their own distributors. Their partners are: Kosmos, Amigo Spiele, Zoch Verlag (Noris), Fantasy Flight Games, Bioviva, etc. They buy the rights for certain games from these companies and then make Slovenian, and lately Croatian and/or Serbian versions. Among their most famous games is certainly Catan (formerly Settlers of the Island of Catan), which they created for the first time in the Croatian language in 2006. This year, they created a completely new version that includes three languages ​​- Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian, and they started localizing the expansion of this game into Croatian.",
